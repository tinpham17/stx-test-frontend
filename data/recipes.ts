    title: "Whole Grain Banana Bread",
    description: "This one-bowl banana bread — our 2018 Recipe of the Year — uses the simplest ingredients, but is incredibly moist and flavorful. While the recipe calls for a 50/50 mix of flours (all-purpose and whole wheat), we often make the bread 100% whole wheat, and honestly? No one can tell, it's that good! And not only is this bread delicious — it's versatile.",

Depending on how you observe Passover, this cake can make a great addition to your Seder since it contains neither flour nor leavening; and of course, it's also ideal for those looking to avoid gluten.",

    description: "With its bright lemon flavor, plush texture, and over-the-top size, this elegant Savarin cake is perfect for feeding a crowd. The fabulous, fine crumb of the cake comes from a fun trick: Instead of relying on butter or oil for richness, this cake starts off with whipped cream, which makes it simultaneously light and luscious. Fresh berries and even more whipped cream are loaded into the center of the cake for a beautiful presentation and a built-in topping for every slice.",

    title: "Twice-Baked Caramelized Cashew Baklava",
    description: "In this baklava recipe from Sohla El-Waylly’s cookbook Start Here, tight coils of phyllo dough are scrunched around cardamom-scented ground cashews, baked, and soaked in orange syrup. The next move is up to you: Either let the baklava cool as is, for a syrupy, sticky treat, or return the pan to the oven, where the syrup will reduce, caramelize, deepen in flavor, and become chewy and candy-like. Not traditional, but highly delicious. Baklava comes in thousands of forms — layered flat and cut in diamonds, scrunched into rolls or nests — and Sohla loves this version because the coils of dough don’t shatter or make a mess and the filling stays put. (Not to mention: It’s hypnotizing to look at!)",
